MILESTONE PROJECT ONE - USER CENTRIC FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT 
# Gym|mies A gym for the stay-at-home mums
This project features a website of a gym that caters towards stay-at-home mothers. 
The website is designed to be simple to use, easy on the eyes and sufficiently informative at first glance.
The user will be able to scroll through a image carousel, request a schedule to be sent via email through a modal pop-up form
and asked to be contacted through a contact form.

# UX
## User stories
### Visitor to the website 
* I want to have a visual idea of what to expect at this gym, so images would be nice. 
* I don't want too much text to scroll through to read, as a busy mother I don't have all day to read.
* I want to be able to easily access information that I need with as little clicking as possible.
* I want to know what kind of services to expect, and what kind of packages and prices there are.
* I want to be able contact someone for information. 

### Business developer for website 
* I want to give users a visually comfortable experience on the website, calm colours and simple layout.
* I want users to be able to find the information they need quickly, so easy navigation is important.
* I want to simplify the pricing choices the user will have to make when choosing to sign up.
* I want users to return to the website regularly.

## 1 Strategy 
* The target users to this website are stay-at-home mothers, it has to be simple and not time consuming to navigate.
* This website needs to appeal to them visually, psychologically and emotionally.
* The homepage should already provide, at first glance, all the vital information about the business. It should answer questions like:
    * Does this have all the services I need? 
    * What are the opening times?
    * Where is it located?
    * Where can I find further information?
    * Are there any upcoming events? (provided in carousel)
* Provide one feature that would require the user to return to the website on a regular basis.

## 2 Scope 
* A carousel slide and multiple images to provide visual representation of the business that the website features.
* Easy to navigate within the website.
* A visual outline of the services provided on the landing page.
* Provide a reason to return to the website - requesting updated schedule. 
* Allow the user to request for contact and choose the method of how they wish to be contacted.

## 3 Structure 
* The consistent features throughout all pages on the websites are:
    * Logo at the top 
    * Website navigation bar just under the Logo
    * Social navigation icons at the footer
* The homepage provides an impression, the images in the carousel and the boxes with icons of the services provided will give the users a good idea of what to expect.
* The about page will provide simple information outlining what the business is about, what kind of package is offered and the kind of pricing that is available.

## 4 Skeleton 
* Logo - Clickable link that brings user back to homepage.
* Navigation bar :
    * Home - returns user to homepage 
    * About - information about the business, package details and pricing
    * Services - alert with button that opens up a modal form for users to fill in name and email address. Images and descriptive text about the different services available.
    * Contact - A form for users to fill in to request for communication.

## 5 Surface 
### Colors :
The color palette I choose comes from [Colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) 
I choose this color palette for its naturally and calming feel, and it doesn't distract from the content of the website.

### Typography :
"Pacifico" font family used mainly for the logo but also appears twice in About for content titles.
"Roboto" font family is primary for the entire body of the website.
